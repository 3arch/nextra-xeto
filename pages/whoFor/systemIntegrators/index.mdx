# Xeto Inheritance Demonstration

In Xeto, one of the main features is the inheritance model that allows us to define and extend types/specs easily. Let's demonstrate this by using an example of a Vehicle, which we can extend to a Car and a Truck.

## Defining a Vehicle

First, we'll define a generic Vehicle type/spec:

```xeto filename="Sample Xeto Code"
Vehicle : Equipment {
  wheels: 4
  fuel: "gasoline"
}
```



In this case, `Vehicle` is a type that extends `Equipment`. It has two properties, `wheels` and `fuel`.

## Extending to a Car

Next, we can extend `Vehicle` to create a `Car` type/spec:

```xeto filename="Sample Xeto Code"
Car : Vehicle {
  doors: 4
  sunroof: true
}
```

Here, `Car` extends `Vehicle`, thus it inherits the properties of `Vehicle` (`wheels` and `fuel`) and adds two more properties, `doors` and `sunroof`.

## Extending to a Truck

Similarly, we can extend `Vehicle` to create a `Truck` type/spec:

```xeto filename="Sample Xeto Code"
Truck : Vehicle {
  doors: 2
  bedLength: "8 feet"
}
```

In this case, `Truck` also inherits the properties of `Vehicle` and adds its own properties, `doors` and `bedLength`.

This way, we can create and extend types/specs in Xeto with ease. Inheritance allows us to carry forward properties and tags from the parent type/spec, reducing redundancy and improving clarity.
