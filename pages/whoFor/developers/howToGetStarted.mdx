# Xeto is designed to run anywhere
We are tyring to make it easy to get up and started. The following is a list on how to build locally. You can also just use `Xeto.dev` connected to gitHub, and it will do all your build and resolve all your dependencies. It's our goal to make it extrely easy to get started, and to make it easy for non developers too. 

# Install using npm

You can also install Xeto as a Node.js module via npm. This is convenient if you are developing a Node.js application that needs to interact with Xeto. Here's how you can install Xeto using npm:

```bash
npm install xeto
```

# Install using Deno

If you're using Deno, a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, you can import Xeto directly from the Deno libraries. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import Xeto from 'https://deno.land/x/xeto/mod.ts';
```


## Install on macOS

The quickest way to get going with Xeto on macOS is to use Homebrew. This will install both the command-line tools, and the Xeto server as a single executable. If you don't use Homebrew, follow the instructions for Linux below to install Xeto. View the [documentation](https://xeto.com/docs) for more information.

```bash
brew install xeto/tap/xeto
```

## Install on Linux

The easiest and preferred way to get going with Xeto on Unix operating systems is to install and use the Xeto command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions. View the [documentation](https://xeto.com/docs) for more information.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.xeto.dev | sh
```

## Install on Windows

The easiest and preferred way to get going with Xeto on Windows is to install and use the Xeto command-line tool. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions. View the [documentation](https://xeto.com/docs) for more information.

```powershell
iwr https://windows.xeto.com -useb | iex
```

Alternatively, Xeto is available for installation, on Windows, via the Chocolatey package manager, from an administrative shell - enabling easy installation and upgrading.

```powershell
choco install xeto --pre
```

Alternatively, Xeto is available for installation, on Windows, via the Scoop package manager, from an administrative shell - enabling easy installation and upgrading.

```powershell
scoop install xeto
```

## Run using Docker

Docker can be used to manage and run Xeto database instances without the need to install any command-line tools. The Xeto docker container contains the full command-line tools for importing and exporting data from a running server, or for running a server itself. View the [documentation](https://xeto.com/docs) for more information.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 8000:8000 xeto/xeto:latest start
```
