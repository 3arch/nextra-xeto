## Frequently Asked Questions about Xeto

1. **What is Xeto?**  
Xeto is a declarative language that is primarily used for modeling, especially smart buildings and IoT devices. Its syntax is clear and easy to understand, allowing for quick creation of models and resources.

2. **How do I create a new type in Xeto?**  
You can create a new type using the following syntax:

    ```javascript filename="Sample Xeto Code"
    Building : Resource {
      rooms: List<Room>
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, `Building` is a new type that extends `Resource` and has a property `rooms` which is a list of another type `Room`.

3. **What is a marker tag in Xeto?**  
A marker tag in Xeto is a boolean tag that simply marks a type with a certain attribute. For example:

    ```javascript filename="Sample Xeto Code"
    MyType : BaseType<myMarkerTag> {
      someProperty
    }
    ```
    
    Here, `myMarkerTag` is a marker tag.

4. **How do I create an instance of a type in Xeto?**  
Creating an instance of a type in Xeto can be achieved like this:

    ```javascript filename="Sample Xeto Code"
    myBuilding := Building {
      rooms: []
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, `myBuilding` is an instance of the `Building` type.

5. **Can I extend multiple types in Xeto?**  
In Xeto, a type can extend multiple other types by using the `Union` keyword. For example:

    ```javascript filename="Sample Xeto Code"
    MyType : Union<BaseType1, BaseType2> {
      property1
      property2
    }
    ```
    
    Here, `MyType` is a new type that extends both `BaseType1` and `BaseType2`.

6. **How does Xeto handle inheritance?**  
Inheritance in Xeto is achieved through type extension. When a type extends another, it inherits all of its properties and behavior. For example:

    ```javascript filename="Sample Xeto Code"
    MySubType : MyType {
      newProperty
    }
    ```
    
    Here, `MySubType` inherits all properties and behavior from `MyType`.

7. **What is metadata in Xeto?**  
Metadata in Xeto can be added directly to the type definitions, providing extra information about a type. For example:

    ```javascript filename="Sample Xeto Code"
    MyType : BaseType<myMetadata:"someValue"> {
      someProperty
    }
    ```
    
    Here, `myMetadata` is a piece of metadata with the value `"someValue"`.

8. **Can I use Xeto for applications other than smart buildings?**  
Yes, while Xeto is particularly effective for modeling smart buildings, it can be used to model any domain.

9. **How do I add a list of types in Xeto?**  
Here is an example of how you can add a list of types:

    ```javascript filename="Sample Xeto Code"
    Building : Resource {
      rooms: List<Room>
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, `rooms` is a list of `Room` types.

10. **What is the difference between Xeto and traditional programming languages?**  
Xeto is a declarative specification language, which means it describes what something is. Traditional programming languages, on the other hand, describe how to perform tasks. This
