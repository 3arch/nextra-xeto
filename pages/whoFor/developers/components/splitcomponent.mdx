## SplitComponent

The `SplitComponent` is a versatile component that allows you to render an image and content side by side. It provides a visually appealing way to present information with an accompanying image.

<SplitComponent>

    ## Database, realtime API layer, and security permissions all-in-one
    SurrealDB combines the database layer, the querying layer, and the API and authentication layer into one platform. Advanced table-based and row-based customisable access permissions allow for granular data access patterns for different types of users. There's no need for custom backend code and security rules with complicated database development.

</SplitComponent>

### Usage

To use the `SplitComponent`, follow these steps:

1. Import the `SplitComponent` into your React application:

   ```jsx copy
   import SplitComponent from "../../../../components/SplitComponent/";

2. Render the **SplitComponent** in your JSX code, providing the title, description, and image link as children:

    ```mdx copy
    <SplitComponent>
        ## Title
        Description
        {/* this space is required */}
        ![](Image-Link)
    </SplitComponent>
    ```
Note: Replace Title with your desired heading title, Description with the corresponding description text, and Image-Link with the URL of the image you want to render.

### Structure Requirements

When using the `SplitComponent`, make sure to follow this structure:

1. `## Title` - This specifies the title for the split component.
2. `Description` - This provides the description for the split component.
3. `![](Image-Link)` - This includes the image link within the Markdown syntax.

Ensure that the title, description, and image link are defined within the `SplitComponent` in the specified structure.



### Example
Here is an example of how you can use the **SplitComponent:**

```jsx copy
<SplitComponent>
  ## Database, realtime API layer, and security permissions all-in-one
  SurrealDB combines the database layer, the querying layer, and the API and authentication layer into one platform. Advanced table-based and row-based customisable access permissions allow for granular data access patterns for different types of users. There's no need for custom backend code and security rules with complicated database development.

</SplitComponent>
```

In this example, the **SplitComponent** is used to render the content with the title "Database, realtime API layer, and security permissions all-in-one", the corresponding description, and an image.

By using the **SplitComponent**, you can create visually appealing sections with images and accompanying content in your React application

### This is the SplitComponent implementation

```jsx copy filename="SplitComponent.tsx"
import React from "react";
import * as classes from "./splitcomponent.module.css";
export interface StyleProps {
  className?: string;
  style?: React.CSSProperties;
}
interface SliptComponentProps extends StyleProps {
  children?: any;
}

function SplitComponent(props: SliptComponentProps) {
  const { children, className, style } = props;

  let heading,
    image: {
      src: string;
      alt: string;
    },
    description;

  try {
    heading = children[0].props.children;
    description = children[1].props.children;
    image = children[2].props.children.props;
  } catch (err) {
    return "Please specify the proper format";
  }

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-6">
      <div className={classes.imageWrapper + " flex-1"}>
        {image ? (
          <img src={image.src} alt={image.alt} className="w-[80%]" />
        ) : null}
      </div>
      <div className="flex-1">
        <h1 className={classes.heading}>{heading}</h1>
        <p className={classes.description}>{description}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default SplitComponent;
