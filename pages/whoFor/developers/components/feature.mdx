## Feature Component Documentation

The `Feature` component is a React component that allows you to render a single feature with a title, description, and tag. It provides a way to highlight individual features in your application.

<div style={{marginTop: "30px"}} />

<Feature>
  ### Multi-table, multi-row transactions As a fully ACID
  compliant database, SurrealDB allows you to run transactions across
  multiple-rows, and across multiple different tables. There is no limit to the
  length of time a transaction can run.
### COMPLETE:planned
</Feature>

### Usage

To use the `Feature` component, follow the steps below:

1. Import the `Feature` component into your React application:

   ```jsx
   import Feature from "./Feature";
   ```
2. Render the `Feature` component in your JSX code, providing the title, description, and tag as children:

```mdx
<Feature>
  ### Title
  Description
  ### tagText:colorSpecifier
</Feature>
```


Note: Ensure that the title, description, and tag are defined within the Feature component in the specified structure.

### Structure Requirements

When using the `Feature` component, make sure to follow this structure:

1. `### Title` - This specifies the title for the feature.
2. `Description` - This provides a description for the feature.
3. `### tagText:colorSpecifier` - This defines the tag for the feature, where `tagText` represents the text to display in the tag, and `colorSpecifier` specifies the color of the tag. The `colorSpecifier` can be one of the following: "future", "planned", or "completed".

Ensure that the feature is placed on separate lines and follows the specified structure to ensure proper rendering of the `Feature` component.



### Example

```jsx copy filename="App.tsx"
function App() {
  return (
    <Feature>

      ### COMPLETE:planned
    </Feature>
  );
}

export default App;
```
In this example, the **Feature** component is used to render a single feature. It has the title "Multi-table, multi-row transactions," a description, and a tag with the text "COMPLETE" and the color "planned".

### Features Component Integration

If you need to render multiple features, you can use the **Features** component. The **Features** component allows you to render multiple features with titles, descriptions, and tags. You can find the documentation for the **Features** component here(fsdfkjn).
