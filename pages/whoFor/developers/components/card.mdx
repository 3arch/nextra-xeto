### Usage

To use the `Card` component, follow these steps:

1. Import the `Card` component into your React application:

   ```jsx copy
   import Card from "./Card";
    ```
2. Render the Card component in your JSX code, providing the title, description, and icon image as children:
    ```mdx copy 
    <Card>
        ## Title
        Description
        {/* <this space is necessary> */}
        ![](Icon-Image-Link)
    </Card>
    ```
Note: Make sure to replace Title with your desired title, Description with your desired description, and Icon-Image-Link with the URL of the icon image you want to display in the card.


### Structure Requirements

When using the `Card` component, make sure to follow this structure:

1. `## Title` - This specifies the title for the card.
2. `Description` - This provides a description for the card.
3. `<this space is necessary>` - This empty line is necessary to separate the description from the icon image.
4. `![](Icon-Image-Link)` - This includes the icon image in the card. Replace `Icon-Image-Link` with the URL of the desired icon image.

Ensure that the title, description, and icon image are defined within the `Card` component in the specified structure.

### Example
Here is an example of how you can use the **Card** component
```mdx copy
<Card>
