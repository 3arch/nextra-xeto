## Layout Component Documentation

The `Layout` component is a reusable React component that provides a flexible layout for rendering child components side by side. It allows you to define the number of columns in which the child components should be arranged.

### Usage

To use the `Layout` component, follow the steps below:

1. Import the `Layout` component into your React application:

   ```jsx
   import Layout from "../../../../components/Layout/Layout";
   ```

2. Render the `Layout` component in your JSX code, providing the desired number of columns as the `columnCount` prop:

   ```jsx
   <Layout columnCount={2}>{/* Add your child components here */}</Layout>
   ```

3. Place the child components within the opening and closing tags of the `Layout` component. These child components will be arranged side by side based on the specified `columnCount`:

   ```mdx
   <Layout columnCount={2}>
     <Button>One</Button>
     <Button>Two</Button>
   </Layout>
   ```

### Props

The `Layout` component accepts the following props:

- `columnCount` (optional): Specifies the number of columns in which the child components should be arranged. It expects a number value. If not provided, the default value is `1`.

### Example

## The Actual Component

```jsx copy filename="Layout.jsx"
import React from "react";
import classes from "./layout.module.css";

interface Props {
  children?: any;
  columnCount?: number;
}

function Layout(props: Props) {
  let { children, columnCount = 1 } = props;
  let width = 100;

  if ((columnCount = 2)) {
    width = width / columnCount;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div
        className={classes.layout}
        style={
          columnCount
            ? {
                gridTemplateColumns: `repeat(${columnCount}, 1fr)`,
              }
            : {}
        }
      >
        {children.map((child) => (
          <div style={{ width: width + "%", padding: "0 10px" }}>{child}</div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default Layout;
```
