# Xeto Cmd Line

Intro

Using version haxall version 3.1.8 (I assume same as 3.1.7.902)

## Xeto CLI (bin/xeto)

### env

- ‘bin/xeto env’
- shows what libraries you have installed as xetolib files

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Show installed libraries"
```

- sys library has core libraries

### init

- ‘bin/xeto init \<libName\>’
- creating your own library
- input is name of new lib

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Creating new library"
```

- output is two files lib.xeto and spec.xeto
- once you run it, you’ll now see it when you run ‘bin/xeto env’
- if you have the source code local, it will use the source code denoted as “SRC”

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Output is two files lib.xeto and spec.xeto"
```

### build

- ‘bin/xeto build \<libName\>’
- creates a xetolib file in your lib/xeto dir

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Creating a xetolib file"
```

## VS Code

### lib.xeto

- metadata for library
- version is always a 3 digit version

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Metadata for library"
```

### spec.xeto

- all spec are defined here
- not much else....not sure if he was planning on saying more here
- (this shows up again more in depth at the 8min mark when explaining scalars)

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "All specs are defined here"
```

## Axon CLI

Might need to run ‘chmod +x bin/*’ to run axon executable

Start CLI with ‘bin/axon’

Using(\"*\")

- initialize the libraries you want to use (in this case * means all available)

Reload

- called using dataEnvReload()
- will update if you change a local source library, no build needed unless you need a new xetolib file

Print spec, AST

- dump the spec list from a library
- print( MySpec, "doc")
- specAst(MySpec)
- specAst(MySpec).print("json")

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Print spec, AST"
```

## Scalars

- defined as \<varName\>: \<varType\> \<varValue\>

### Numbers, Dates

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Numbers, Dates"
```

- both above slot syntax’s are identical in output

### Str default

- if you leave off the varType, it defaults to a string

### Markers

- can define marker type, or just leave of varType and varValue to default to marker

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Markers"
```

### Custom Scalars

- can create whatever new scalars by extending Scalar type

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Custom Scalars"
```

- Above, Color is a new type extending Scalar

## Seq or Sequences (Collection types)

### Dict name/unnamed

- unnamed dict values are given the _0, _1, _2, etc naming convention

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Dict name/unnamed"
```

## Testing

Can write tests within the Spec

- test using assert()

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Testing"
```

## VS Code

**Format code**

- Right click and ‘format document’
- all scalars move to top (this isn’t necessary but they seem to like it)

**Create new type (extending Dict)**

- create a new spec to use your custom type

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Create new type (extending Dict)"
```

## Using (\"libraryName\")

- initialize libraries you want to use

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Using(\"libraryName\")"
```

### Import specs

- importing a spec

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Import specs"
```

## Factory Function (example of Function)

- makeFactory function creating a factory that creates new animals

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Factory Function (example of Function)"
```

### Import type

- import a type (not a spec)

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Import type"
```

## Load local source library

- loading a local library

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Load local source library"
```

### Reload

- Reload if source changes

```bash copy filename="Command Line"
echo "Reload"
```

## Conclusion

This was a basic introduction to Xeto language.
