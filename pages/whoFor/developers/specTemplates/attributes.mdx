## Understanding and Using Attributes in Xeto

### What are Attributes?

In Xeto, attributes are additional information or properties added to a specification. They allow the definition of characteristics or properties of a spec that may not necessarily fit into the core schema. 

### How to Use Attributes in Xeto

In a Xeto spec, attributes are added as follows:

1. Create a new spec/type.
2. Add an `attributes` section.
3. Within this section, list your attributes, each having a unique name and a corresponding value.

Here's a simple example:

```ts
MyEquipment: Equipment {
  attributes: {
    manufacturer: "MyCompany"
    model: "Model123"
  }
}
```
<button className="nx-bg-primary-100"> Cool Text</button>
### Code Examples for Attributes

Here is an example of a Xeto specification where the `OniconF4300FlowMeter` spec has attributes:

```js filename="Onicon F-3400 Flow Meter"
// Onicon F-4300 flow meter
OniconF4300FlowMeter : FlowMeter {
  attributes: {
    manufacturer: "Onicon"
    model: "F-4300"
  }
}
```
