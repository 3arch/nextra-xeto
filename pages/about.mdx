# Xeto Spec Properties Explanation

- `type: Type?`: This field is used to reference the value type if this spec is not a type.
- `maybe: Marker? <noInherit>`: Indicates that this type is optional. It doesn't inherit this marker from parent types/specs.
- `val: Obj?`: The default scalar value, if any, for this type.
- `slots: Dict <of:Spec>`: The dictionary of slot specifications for this type.
- `of: Spec?`: Specifies the item type for container types like `Maybe`, `Seq`, and `Ref`.
- `ofs: List? <of:Spec>`: The types used in compound types like `And` and `Or`.
- `doc: Str`: A documentation description for the spec.
- `abstract: Marker? <noInherit>`: Indicates that the spec is an abstract type and cannot be implemented directly by instance data. It doesn't inherit this marker from parent types/specs.
- `sealed: Marker? <noInherit>`: Indicates that the spec is a sealed type and cannot be extended outside of its own library. It doesn't inherit this marker from parent types/specs.
- `nodoc: Marker?`: Marks the spec as undocumented and not officially supported.
- `pattern: Str?`: A regex pattern for scalar string encoding, if any.
- `minVal: Self?`: The inclusive minimum value for this type.
- `maxVal: Self?`: The inclusive maximum value for this type.
- `via: Str?`: A named path to traverse to execute a query.
- `inverse: Spec?`: Specifies an inverse query to run against a parent spec.

In the `Lib: Spec`:

- `version: Version`: The current version of the library.
- `depends: List <of:LibDepend>`: A list of library dependencies.
- `org: LibOrg`: Organization metadata for the library.

Note: `Self` in the context of `minVal` and `maxVal` refers to the type that the properties are within.
