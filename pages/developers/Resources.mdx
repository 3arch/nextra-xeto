## Resources in Types/Specs

### What are Resources?

In Xeto, resources are the files that can be linked to a specification/type. These can be anything from images, datasheets, to other relevant documents that support or provide additional context to the defined spec. The files can be hosted locally or remotely.

### Adding Resources to Types/Specs

In a Xeto spec, resources are added as follows:

1. Create a new spec/type.
2. Add a `resources` section.
3. Within this section, list your resources as instances of predefined resource types such as `Image`, `Pdf`, `Document`, etc.
4. For each resource instance, specify its `uri` - a string that points to the location of the file.

Here's a simple example:

```
MyEquipment: Equipment {
  resources: {
    Document {
      uri: "http://example.com/document.pdf"
    }
    Image {
      uri: "http://example.com/image.jpg"
    }
  }
}
```

### Code Examples for Resources

Here is an example of a Xeto specification where the `OniconF4300FlowMeter` spec has resources linked to it:

```
// Onicon F-4300 flow meter
OniconF4300FlowMeter : FlowMeter {
  resources: {
    Pdf {
      uri: "https://www.onicon.com/wp-content/uploads/ONICON-F-4300-Clamp-On-Ultrasonic-Flow-Meter-For-Water-Based-Liquids-Specification-Sheet.pdf"
    }
    Image {
      uri: "https://www.onicon.com/wp-content/uploads/F-4300-Ultrasonic-Flow-Meter1-1024x724.jpg"
    }
  }
}
```
