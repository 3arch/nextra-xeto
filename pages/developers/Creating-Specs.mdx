# Creating and Extending Types and Instances in Xeto, TypeScript, and JavaScript

This document demonstrates the creation and extension of types, as well as how to create an instance, in Xeto, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

## Xeto

### Creating a New Type

In Xeto, a new type (also known as a spec) can be created as shown below. Note the capitalization of the type name and the use of \`:\` to indicate its extension from an existing type.

```
Resource : Dict {
    uri: Uri
}
```

### Extending a Type

In Xeto, we extend a type by creating a new type that references the parent type before the \`:\`.

```
Document : Resource {
  document
}
```

### Creating an Instance

An instance in Xeto is created using a type and assigning values to its properties, notice that there is no `:` below when creating the new instance. It only has `ExcelDocuemnt`, this means you are creating a new instance of ExcelDocument.

```
// ONICON-Product-Comprehensive-Order-Form-Workbook_Rev-16
ExcelDocument {
  uri: "https://www.onicon.com/wp-content/uploads/ONICON-Product-Comprehensive-Order-Form-Workbook_Rev-16.xlsx"
}
```

## TypeScript

In TypeScript, a similar process can be done, but it is more verbose due to the explicit syntax. Here's how it would look:

### Creating a New Type

```
interface Resource {
    uri: string;
}
```

### Extending a Type

In TypeScript, types (interfaces) are extended using the \`extends\` keyword:

```
interface Document extends Resource {
    document: any;
}
```

### Creating an Instance

Creating an instance in TypeScript is similar to JavaScript. We first create an object of the type:

```
let exampleDocument: Document = {
    uri: "https://www.onicon.com/wp-content/uploads/ONICON-Product-Comprehensive-Order-Form-Workbook_Rev-16.xlsx",
    document: any // Fill this with your own value
};
```

## JavaScript

JavaScript, unlike TypeScript and Xeto, does not support explicit interfaces or types. However, we can mimic similar behavior with constructor functions or classes:

### Creating a New Type

```
function Resource(uri) {
    this.uri = uri;
}
```

### Extending a Type

In JavaScript, types are "extended" by setting the prototype of the constructor function:

```
function Document(uri, document) {
    Resource.call(this, uri);
    this.document = document;
}

Document.prototype = Object.create(Resource.prototype);
```

### Creating an Instance

Creating an instance in JavaScript is done using the \`new\` keyword:

```
let exampleDocument = new Document("https://www.onicon.com/wp-content/uploads/ONICON-Product-Comprehensive-Order-Form-Workbook_Rev-16.xlsx", any); // Replace any with your own value
```

Note that Xeto has a more compact syntax and natively supports type inheritance, unlike JavaScript. TypeScript, while more verbose, also provides powerful type safety and inheritance features.
