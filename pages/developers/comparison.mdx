# Xeto vs Other Languages

## Comparison: Xeto vs TypeScript

### Similarities

Xeto and TypeScript share some similarities as they both aim to bring types and interfaces into the world of JavaScript, which is originally a dynamically typed language. Both TypeScript and Xeto let you define custom types and interfaces, enforcing a schema onto your data. This can help prevent many common bugs that come from incorrect data types or structures. Here is a comparison example:

In TypeScript:

```
interface Car {
    make: string;
    model: string;
    year: number;
}

let myCar: Car = {
    make: 'Tesla',
    model: 'Model S',
    year: 2023};
```

In Xeto:

```
TeslaCar:Car {
    make: Str;
    model: Str;
    year: Num;
}

myCar : {
    make: 'Tesla',
     model: 'Model S',
      year: 2023};
```

### Differences

While there are similarities, there are also significant differences between Xeto and TypeScript:

1. **Computation**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and includes computation abilities. Xeto, on the other hand, focuses solely on the data model. It does not have computation capabilities or any logic built in.

2. **Validation**: Xeto emphasizes the validation of data, allowing you to verify the legitimacy of data against a defined spec. TypeScript does not have an in-built mechanism for such validation.

3. **Scope**: TypeScript is a general-purpose language that can be used to develop any kind of application. Xeto, however, is designed specifically for creating Specs/Types and instance data, mainly targeting system integrators, developers, and OEMs working with structured data models.

### When to use each

- Use TypeScript when you are building general purpose applications, and you need the power of a fully-fledged programming language with static typing.

- Use Xeto when you are working with structured data models and need to define, validate, and query these models. It's ideal for system integrators, developers, and OEMs who need a powerful and flexible system for creating and managing typed data.
