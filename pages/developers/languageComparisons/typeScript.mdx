# Xeto vs Other Languages

## Comparison: Xeto vs TypeScript

### Similarities

Xeto and TypeScript share some similarities as they both aim to bring types and interfaces into the world of JavaScript, which is originally a dynamically typed language. Both TypeScript and Xeto let you define custom types and interfaces, enforcing a schema onto your data. This can help prevent many common bugs that come from incorrect data types or structures. Here is a comparison example:

In TypeScript:

```
interface Car {
    make: string;
    model: string;
    year: number;
}

let myCar: Car = {
    make: 'Tesla',
    model: 'Model S',
    year: 2023};
```

In Xeto:

```
TeslaCar:Car {
    make: Str;
    model: Str;
    year: Num;
}

myCar : {
    make: 'Tesla',
     model: 'Model S',
      year: 2023};
```

### Differences

While there are similarities, there are also significant differences between Xeto and TypeScript:

1. **Computation**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and includes computation abilities. Xeto, on the other hand, focuses solely on the data model. It does not have computation capabilities or any logic built in.

2. **Validation**: Xeto emphasizes the validation of data, allowing you to verify the legitimacy of data against a defined spec. TypeScript does not have an in-built mechanism for such validation.

3. **Scope**: TypeScript is a general-purpose language that can be used to develop any kind of application. Xeto, however, is designed specifically for creating Specs/Types and instance data, mainly targeting system integrators, developers, and OEMs working with structured data models.

### When to use each

- Use TypeScript when you are building general purpose applications, and you need the power of a fully-fledged programming language with static typing.

- Use Xeto when you are working with structured data models and need to define, validate, and query these models. It's ideal for system integrators, developers, and OEMs who need a powerful and flexible system for creating and managing typed data.

# Xeto, TypeScript, and Metadata

Metadata, also known as decorators or annotations in other programming languages, is a method for adding additional data to code constructs such as classes, methods, or properties.

## Xeto

In Xeto, metadata can be attached to a type or spec. This is demonstrated in the following example, where we create a new type `Document` extending from `Resource`, and include metadata `foo`, `year`, and `test`:

```
Document : Resource<foo,year:"2020",test:MySites> {
  document
}
```

In this example, `foo` is a marker tag, `year` is a number tag with a value of `2020`, and `test` is another tag whose value is a Type/Spec called `MySites`. These tags within the angled brackets (`< >`) constitute the metadata of the `Document` type.

## TypeScript

In TypeScript, a similar feature to metadata is provided through the concept of `decorators`. Decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter.

Consider this example:

```
@foo
@year(2020)
@test(MySites)
class Document extends Resource {
    document: any;
}
```

Here, `@foo`, `@year`, and `@test` are decorators applied to the `Document` class. The `foo` decorator corresponds to a marker, while the `year` and `test` decorators correspond to the tags in Xeto's metadata. The `@` symbol is used to apply a decorator to a class.

However, please note that decorators are an experimental feature of TypeScript as of September 2021, and their usage may change in future releases.


In Xeto:

```
Resource : Dict{
    uri: Str
    year: Num "2019"   
}
```

In TypeScript:

```
class Resource {
    uri: string;
    year: number = 2019;
}
```

In Xeto, we're defining a new specification type called `Resource` which extends a built-in specification `Dict`. This `Resource` type has two slots `uri` and `year`, with `uri` being of type `Str` and `year` being of type `Num` with an initial value of 2019. 

In TypeScript, we're defining a new class called `Resource` which has two properties `uri` and `year`. The `uri` property is of type `string` and the `year` property is of type `number` with an initial value of 2019.

The key differences between these two languages in this scenario are:

1. Xeto is a declarative language for data modeling where we specify "what" rather than "how". It focuses on the structure and semantics of the data. On the other hand, TypeScript is a programming language which includes mechanisms for creating, managing and manipulating objects and classes.

2. In Xeto, we are extending from a built-in specification `Dict` whereas in TypeScript we are creating a new class from scratch.

3. The way we specify types and initialize them is different in the two languages. In Xeto, we use `Str` and `Num` types with the values enclosed in double-quotes, whereas in TypeScript, we use `string` and `number` types and the values are not enclosed in quotes.
