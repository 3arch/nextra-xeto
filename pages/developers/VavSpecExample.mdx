## 9. Templates in Xeto: Example of a G36Vav

### What is a G36Vav?

A `G36Vav` (Guideline 36 Variable Air Volume) in this context is a template for a VAV terminal unit as per the standards defined in ASHRAE Guideline 36. These are designed for high-performance, automated buildings aiming to maximize energy efficiency and performance.

### Creating a G36Vav Template

In Xeto, a `G36Vav` type can be defined by extending a base `Vav` type and adding in points relevant to the G36 guideline. This might include a variety of sensors and setpoints. For example:

```
// Guidline 36 base type for VAVs terminal units
G36Vav : Vav <abstract> {
  points: {
    ZoneAirTempSensor
    ZoneAirTempEffectiveSp
    ZoneOccupiedSensor
    ZoneCo2Sensor
    //{window, override, cmd, point}
  }
}
```

### Extending G36Vav to a Fan-Powered Terminal Unit

In Xeto, you can also create more specific types by extending a base type. In this case, `G36FanPoweredTerminalUnit` extends `G36Vav` and adds additional characteristics and points. This model now also includes fan power, hot water heating, single duct system, and several additional sensors and command points:

```
// Guidline 36 Fan Powered Terminal Unit
G36FanPoweredTerminalUnit : G36Vav {
  fanPowered
  hotWaterHeating
  singleDuct
  points: {
    DischargeFanSpeedCmd
    DischargeFanRunSensor
    DischargeFanRunCmd
    DischargeDamperCmd
    HotWaterValveCmd
    DischargeAirFlowSensor
    DischargeAirTempSensor
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how Xeto allows for defining and extending complex models of building systems that conform to industry standards.
