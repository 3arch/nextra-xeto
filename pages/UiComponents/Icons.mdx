# Icon Designs

We have made progress in designing new icons for our project. After careful consideration, we have selected an open source library that we believe will be a great fit for our needs.

The library is called Lucide, and it features a wide variety of icons across different categories. We particularly like the animal icons, which can be found here: https://lucide.dev/icons/categories#animals

Using an established library like Lucide will save us time and effort while ensuring consistent and professional-looking icons throughout our project.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center ">
  <img 
    src="/resources/screenshots/LucideIcons.png"
    alt="Radix Colors"
    width={650}
    height={650}
    className="pt-10 rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Categories and Tags

We are trying to figure out the best way to model the Icons in Xeto. Jason likes categories and tags, and Brian thinks just tags would be better. 

Below is the Luicide Library design, were there is a `JSON` file and `SVG` file per icon.

```json filename="JSON Icon File accessibility"
{
  "$schema": "../icon.schema.json",
  "contributors": [
    "karsa-mistmere",
    "jguddas"
  ],
  "tags": [
    "disability",
    "disabled",
    "dda",
    "wheelchair"
  ],
  "categories": [
    "accessibility",
    "medical"
  ]
}
```

```html filename="SVG Icon File for accessibility"
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  width="24"
  height="24"
  viewBox="0 0 24 24"
  fill="none"
  stroke="currentColor"
  stroke-width="2"
  stroke-linecap="round"
  stroke-linejoin="round"
>
  <circle cx="16" cy="4" r="1" />
  <path d="m18 19 1-7-6 1" />
  <path d="m5 8 3-3 5.5 3-2.36 3.5" />
  <path d="M4.24 14.5a5 5 0 0 0 6.88 6" />
  <path d="M13.76 17.5a5 5 0 0 0-6.88-6" />
</svg>
```

## Xeto Design Solution

```html filename="Xeto Icon Model for accessibility"
Accessibility: Icon{
    disability
    disabled
    dda
    wheelchair
    accessibility
    medical
    svg:"""
        <circle cx="16" cy="4" r="1" />
        <path d="m18 19 1-7-6 1" />
        <path d="m5 8 3-3 5.5 3-2.36 3.5" />
        <path d="M4.24 14.5a5 5 0 0 0 6.88 6" />
        <path d="M13.76 17.5a5 5 0 0 0-6.88-6" />
  """
```

We have eliminated the standard SVG code, as we can now modify all SVG settings dynamically. As a result, we will need to remove the relevant section from the Xeto specification. This change will enable us to exert control over each icon and ensure consistency across all of them when we manipulate the settings.

```html copy
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  width="24"
  height="24"
  viewBox="0 0 24 24"
  fill="none"
  stroke="currentColor"
  stroke-width="2"
  stroke-linecap="round"
  stroke-linejoin="round"
</svg>
```
