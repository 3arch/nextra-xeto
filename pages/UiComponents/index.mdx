# Community Libraries# Ion: A New UI Library for Xeto Files

Welcome to Ion, the new UI library designed specifically to run from Xeto files! Xeto is a type system for modeling data that allows us to have a taxonomy, ontology, and type system. Ion uses Xeto files to define types for its control logic/control engine and for UI.

Some of our primary goals with Ion include creating a no-code to low-code UI builder that also supports customization, making it easy for users to switch between light and dark themes, enabling customization through CSS variables while keeping them to a minimum, and designing a custom React UI and Ion UI that look and feel the same.

To further this aim and support our users, we have created this doc site to help us solve a few key challenges. These include:

- Define what Atomic Design is, and which parts in ION we will use from Atomic Design
- Defining how we can create both light and dark themes by default
- Creating a set of standardized React/Ion component APIs
- Showing how we can stanadrize the React/Ion component API
- Designing low-code or no-code components
- Providing a set of built-in components like Hero and Cards that make styling easier
- Defining the Ion widget loaded next to the React Component without any visible differences

Additionally, this site will be used to help us:

- Define which widgets will be needed initially 
- Provide a place for Icon design, where all icons are modeled in Xeto and a list of all icons is shown

By working collaboratively and following these guidelines, we believe that Ion will be well-positioned to provide the simplest, cleanest, and most customizable user experience possible. Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey!
