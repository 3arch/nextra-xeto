This probably isn't 100% complete for what we need in phase 1.  But it's the basics to flush out the component hierarchy...

Controls/Core:
- Text (styled text)
- Button
- Select (ListBox that displays items in scrollable container)
- SelectButton (dropdown list picker)
- ToggleButton/Checkbox/Switch/Radio (these could be collapsed into Button/Select)
- Menu (maybe menu item, or maybe just list of Actions)
- ScrollBar (currently only used by ScrollBox, could hide)
- ProgressBar

Text Input
- All these subtype from TextInput 
- TextField (simple one line text input)
- TextArea (simple plain multi-line text)
- TextEditor (multi-line, syntax color coding, etc)
- TextDropdown (combobox but without box in name???)

Layout
- All of these subtype from Box
- VBox (column, vertical)
- HBox( row, horizontal)
- EdgeBox (top/bottom using pref h, left/right using pref w, center fill)
- ScrollBox (contains 1 thing that may overflow)
- SashBox (slidable resizable split pane)
- GridBox (simplified CSS grid layout)
- AccordionBox (or collapsable box)

Z-Order Stuff
- Popup: dialog overlay with single click in background close
- Dialog: model/non-model - not sure how sophisticated we need

Document
- Paragraph (`<p>` with embedded span styling)
- Heading (h1, h2, ...h6)
- BullletList/NumberedList (ul, ol bullet/numbers lists, problematic term with ListBox/Select????)

Specials
- Tree (lazily bound data model w/ item renderer)
- Table (will need full feature of SkySpark)
- Chart (all the features of SkySpark)
- Card (I'm not sure props...)

One library I like how they modeled all the "selectable" stuff is this:
