Color Palette Section Doc

## Objective
The objective of this section is to provide a simple and easy-to-use color palette system for our users. 

## Proposed Solution
After discussing various options in our meeting today, we have decided to restrict the users' ability to customize colors to only three options - primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. This will allow us to handle all other colors and ensure design consistency across our platform.

## Reference
We came across a helpful resource while researching solutions for this problem. Radix has implemented a similar system and their approach can be viewed at 

https://www.radix-ui.com/colors. 

<div className="flex items-center justify-center ">
  <img 
    src="/resources/screenshots/RadixColors.png"
    alt="Radix Colors"
    width={650}
    height={650}
    className="pt-10 rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>


Additionally, Tailwind also has customizable color palette options that can be viewed at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center ">
  <img 
    src="/resources/screenshots/tailwindColors.png"
    alt="Radix Colors"
    width={650}
    height={650}
    className="pt-10 rounded-lg shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our goal is to make our color palette system as easy and user-friendly as possible. By utilizing limited color options and building on the expertise of others in the industry, we believe we can achieve that goal.
